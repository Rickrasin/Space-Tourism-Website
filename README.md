## Overview

This was a very important project in my life, it may not be the most challenging or intriguing thing in the world, but it has a huge emotional appeal for me because I had difficulties in my personal life while developing it.

I developed this project using ReactJS, I started the project using Vite.
This Website helped me reinforce my knowledge of ReactJS and its main libs, libs like StyledComponent, React-Router-dom or FramerMotion.

In the distant future I intend to change some things that I don't agree with and I believe I could have done better on the site.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - For Build & Start Project
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [FramerMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For styles


### What I learned

I may not have implemented it in the project, as it would take time that I could not make available to this project, but I learned a lot about how to develop Slides using libraries in Unity, I also learned the importance of accessibility for the user and improved my knowledge with Responsive Websites.

Something that helped me a lot were the problems with routes I had with the site, this forced me to see a lot of content on the subject and really learn how React-Router-Dom works.
